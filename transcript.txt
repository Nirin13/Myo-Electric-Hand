Niranjan (8/18/2021, 8:30:24 PM): yes 
Gabby C (8/18/2021, 8:31:59 PM): Thank you for waiting. I was able to see that you were enrolled in a schedule that has not started yet. At this time, I was able to move you to an active one that started on August 9, 2021 - September 20, 2021, so you can continue with your learning process and complete the course. 
There might be a chance you get a Join a new schedule button, which will move you to the next available one, the one that hasn't started yet. Please, avoid clicking this button. Please, note that missed deadlines don’t affect your grade in most courses. You'll still be able to earn a Course Certificate once you complete all your work.
